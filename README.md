# phase-o-matic
Python package for calculating Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar phase delays from ERA5 atmospheric models. Utilizes x-array to easily download, processes, and add phase delays to netcdfs of InSAR Phase. This code is primarily adapted from the awesome atmospheric model at: https://github.com/insarlab/PyAPS to utilize netcdfs and xarray.
